        Important Notice to Our Valued Customers
      </strong>
    </div>
    <p>
      We want to inform you of a pause on all subscriptions, re-orders, and new purchases, including urine test cards
      and
      supplements. During this time, our website and customer support services will be unavailable. However, you can
      continue to use the Vessel app to scan cards and access your test results until September 15th, 2024.

      We recognize this may impact your testing routine and recommend using all your remaining test cards by the above
      date.
      We will update you as soon as our services resume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your understanding and ongoing support.</p>
